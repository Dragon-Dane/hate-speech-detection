# Feature Engineering

Four types of feature spaces were engineered including TF-IDF (weighted score and matrix), N-grams (char and word level), typed-dependencies, and sentiment scores. Different text-corpus pre-processing steps were required for each of the feature spaces, which will be described in detail below.
